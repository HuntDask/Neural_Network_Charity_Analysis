# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
 
## Overview of the project
In our project, we creating neural networks and deep learning models to collect data about charities. We are asked to analyze and the impact of each charity donation and predict which charities are best to donate towards. Vex, our company, is in charge of data collection and analysis for the entire organization. Many donations are not as impactful as people think, and many orgnaizations take some percentage of the money that is donated. The company ALphapbet soup has asked us at Vex to create a mathmatical data driven solution to determine and predict the most loyal and faithful charities that the money could go towards. We are desigining and training modules using he python library and use machine learning as well to help create a robust neural network to help determine our charity data set.
